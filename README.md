# TzBlockchainDataView

The main idea was to create an Angular application that fetches data from the tzkt.io REST service API
https://api.tzkt.io/

And show a list of blocks in a paged table and the associated details for each one.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Side Notes
Using Angular Material due to the usage of the paginated table.
NgRx for state management.
Some tests included
